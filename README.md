# Data Analytics Practice

This repository contains my daily hands-on work in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data analytics using Python.

The goal of this repo is to build real, practical data skills by working on small real-world datasets every day and documenting the learning process.

## What you will find here
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Pandas practice  
- Visualizations  
- Small analytics experiments on real datasets  

## Why this repo exists
I am using this repository as a learning lab to move from theory to real data work.  
Every folder represents real problems I have worked on and solved.

This repository will keep growing as I continue to practice and improve.
