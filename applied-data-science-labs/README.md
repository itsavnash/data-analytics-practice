This repo is where I’m putting the data science projects I work on while learning
how to solve real problems with data.

I’m working on projects from different areas like housing, finance, marketing,
environment, and forecasting. The idea is to go beyond tutorials and actually
understand how data is used to make decisions.

These projects are inspired by structured labs such as the WorldQuant University
Applied Data Science Lab, but everything here — the code, notebooks, and notes —
is written by me.

Over time, this repo will have:
- Data cleaning and exploration
- Models and predictions
- Charts and results
- Short notes on what I learned and what didn’t work

Some of the original datasets used in training can’t be shared here because of
licensing, so I use public or recreated data when needed to show the same work.

This repo is mainly to track my progress and show how I think about data.
